Batch and PowerShell files for Windows, which I find useful for my daily work

## resize1080.cmd

Creates an jpg with 1080 pixel width.
Draw the image file on the cmd-File to generate a new image in the same folder.

Requires IrfanView. (32 bit, but can easily be adopted to 64 bit)

## renamereports.ps1

PowerShell script which strips time codes from file names.
(I use them for file exported by an analytics software)
